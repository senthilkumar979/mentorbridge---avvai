      "summary": "I gained extensive hands-on experience in JavaScript, React.js, and React Native, contributing significantly to the development of a TypeScript-based React Native application named Stupro. I was responsible for creating multiple pages and modules, including onboarding, Daily Challenges, Profile, and Leaderboard pages, while implementing key features such as carousels, async storage, animations, and navigation. For the onboarding page, I utilized FlatList with default animations and pagination to enhance user experience. On the Daily Challenges page, I mapped tasks dynamically to create an engaging interface. The Profile page was designed with a card-style layout to display user information, streak details, and access to change password and preferences pages. The Leaderboard page showcased a list of top performers based on points earned through daily challenges. I leveraged the react-native-reanimated-carousel package to implement a carousel on the home page and used Async Storage for offline storage of profile details and user credentials. Navigation across the application was seamlessly handled using React Native Navigation, while animations were enhanced with the React Native Reanimated package to improve user experience. Additionally, I collaborated closely with the team to develop and refine application features, actively participating in team discussions, problem-solving sessions, and code reviews in an agile environment. My role also involved using Figma to design sitemaps and structure multiple pages, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience. This experience allowed me to grow as a developer, fostering collaboration, continuous learning, and a strong focus on delivering high-quality solutions.",
